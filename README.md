In this repository we have code that builds a gallery as a web app
the gallery is deployed at https://coa-kens-projects-80fd8888.vercel.app/

However, in case a user wants to run the project on their local computer they can clone the repo at 
https://github.com/kennyg37/COA.git

The repository also contains a challenges folder that perform certain tasks
To run the javascript files the user will need to install node js runtime on their computer
navigate to the challenges folder and run the projects using `node filename`

To run the gallery locally the user can navigate to the src folder and run index.html in their preferred browser
